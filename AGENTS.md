# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Home Assistant custom component for controlling Cosori smart kettles via BLE. Enables direct Bluetooth connection from Home Assistant to monitor and control kettle temperature and heating.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_config_flow.py -v

# Run specific test class or method
uv run pytest tests/test_climate.py::TestCosoriKettleClimateProperties -v
uv run pytest tests/test_protocol.py::test_build_hello_frame -v

# Scan for kettle MAC address
./scan.py
```

Python environment: `uv` with Python 3.13 in `.venv/`

## Architecture

### Component Structure (`custom_components/cosori_kettle_ble/`)

**Python Library (`cosori_kettle/`):**
- `protocol.py` - BLE protocol parser and command builder
- `client.py` - BLE client and connection management
- `kettle.py` - Main kettle control interface

**Home Assistant Integration:**
- `__init__.py` - Component setup and configuration
- `config_flow.py` - Configuration UI flow
- `climate.py` - Climate entity (thermostat)
- `sensor.py`, `binary_sensor.py`, `number.py`, `switch.py` - Entity platforms
- `coordinator.py` - Data update coordinator

**Tests:**
- `tests/` - All tests (library and Home Assistant component tests combined)
  - `test_protocol.py`, `test_client.py`, `test_kettle.py` - Library tests
  - `test_coordinator.py`, `test_config_flow.py`, `test_climate.py` - HA component tests
  - `conftest.py` - Shared fixtures and pytest configuration

### BLE Protocol (see PROTOCOL.md)

**Flow:** Home Assistant connects → polls every 1-2s → receives status via notifications
- Service: 0xFFF0, RX: 0xFFF1 (notify), TX: 0xFFF2 (write)
- Packet types: Status Request (0x22), Status ACK (0x12, 35B), Compact Status (0x22, 18B), Heating Control (0x20)
- Protocol versions: V0 (legacy), V1 (advanced features)

**Critical Details:**
- Temperatures are **Fahrenheit** (no conversion in protocol layer)
- On-base detection: byte 20 (payload[14]), only in Status ACK (35B), not compact status
- BLE TX: chunk >20 byte packets; RX: complete messages, no reassembly
- Validate checksums (V0: sum; V1: iterative subtraction)

### Home Assistant Integration

Provides Climate entity (thermostat) + individual sensors/switches/numbers. All entities are created and managed through the Home Assistant integration platform.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Temperature:** Already in Fahrenheit - don't convert in protocol layer
2. **On-base detection:** Use payload[14] from Status ACK (35B), NOT payload[4] or compact status
3. **Checksums:** V0 ≠ V1 calculation methods
4. **Async functions in Home Assistant:** `bluetooth.async_discovered_service_info()` is NOT async despite the name - it's decorated with `@hass_callback` and returns synchronously. Don't use `await` on it.

## Testing Patterns

- Use `pytest` with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
- Mock BLE operations using `unittest.mock` (`AsyncMock`, `MagicMock`, `patch`)
- Create fixtures for common objects (mock coordinators, config entries, BLE devices)
- Mock `bluetooth.async_discovered_service_info()` as a regular function (not async)
- Follow existing test patterns in `tests/test_climate.py` and `tests/test_config_flow.py`
