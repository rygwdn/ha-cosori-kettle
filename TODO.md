# TODO

- [ ] 04:57:91:74:3B:F4: BleakClient.connect() called without bleak-retry-connector. For reliable connection establishment, use bleak_retry_connector.establish_connection(). See https://github.com/Bluetooth-Devices/bleak-retry-connector
- [ ] Failed to connect: Timeout waiting for connect response while connecting to 04:57:91:74:3B:F4 after 10.0s, disconnect timed out: False, after 20.0s; Failed to start coordinator: Failed to connect: Timeout waiting for connect response while connecting to 04:57:91:74:3B:F4 after 10.0s, disconnect timed out: False, after 20.0s
- [ ] add delayed start - should be another dropdown/input in the climate UI
- [ ] add docs for finding existing reg code and specify that it's only needed if you want to keep using the app too
