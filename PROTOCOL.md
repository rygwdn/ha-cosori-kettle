## Overview

The Cosori kettle uses a proprietary BLE protocol for bidirectional communication. The protocol appears to have two versions:

### V0 Protocol
- Basic temperature control using setpoint commands
- Limited to boil and heat modes

### V1 Protocol
- Advanced features: delayed start, hold/keep-warm timers, custom temperature
- Registration/pairing support
- Baby formula mode
- Completion notifications

Both protocols support:
- Reading kettle status (temperature, heating state, on-base detection)
- Starting and stopping heating
- Real-time status updates via BLE notifications

## BLE Characteristics

The kettle exposes two primary GATT characteristics:

| Characteristic | UUID | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TX** | `0xFFF2` | Write | Send commands to kettle |
| **RX** | `0xFFF1` | Notify | Receive status updates from kettle |

**Service UUID:** `0xFFF0`

### Flow Control & BLE Communication

**20-Byte Chunking for TX (Controller → Kettle):**
- BLE characteristic writes are limited to 20 bytes per write
- Packets larger than 20 bytes MUST be split into 20-byte chunks when sending
- Chunks are sent sequentially without additional framing

**Packet Sizes:**
- Envelope: 6 bytes (fixed)
- Status request: 10 bytes total (6 envelope + 4 payload)

**RX (Kettle → Controller) - Single Complete Messages:**
- Kettle sends complete messages as single notifications
- No multi-chunk reassembly needed for RX
- Status ACK (35 bytes) arrives as a single notification
- Parser receives complete packets, no buffering required

**Request/Response Pattern:**
1. Controller writes command to TX characteristic (0xFFF2)
   - Split into 20-byte chunks if needed
   - Wait for bluetooth protocol ack (not kettle protocol ack). This is handled automatically by libraries like `bleak`
2. Kettle sends via RX notification characteristic (0xFFF1)
   - Always complete messages (no chunking)
3. Response types:
   - Command ACK (frame type 0x12, 4-5 bytes payload)
   - Compact status (frame type 0x22, 12 bytes payload) - unsolicited updates
   - Completion notification (frame type 0x22, 5 bytes payload)

**Example Flow - Set Custom Temperature:**
```
Controller → TX: Set mytemp to 179°F (A522 1C05 00CD 01F3 A300 B3)
Kettle → RX: Command ACK (A512 1C04 0091 01F3 A300) [single notification]
Kettle → RX: Compact status showing new setpoint [single notification]
```

**Example Flow - Status Request:**
```
Controller → TX: Status request (A522 4104 0072 0140 4000) [single write]
Kettle → RX: Status ACK (35 bytes) [single notification - complete packet]
```

## Packet Structure

All packets follow this format:

```
[Header: 6 bytes] [Payload: variable length]
```

### Header Format

| Offset | Field | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Magic | Always `0xA5` |
| 1 | Type | Packet type identifier |
| 2 | Sequence | Packet sequence number (0x00-0xFF, wraps) |
| 3 | Length Low | Payload length low byte |
| 4 | Length High | Payload length high byte |
| 5 | Checksum | Simple checksum (see below) |

### Checksum Calculation

<!-- TODO: is this accurate for v0 packets? -->
The v0 checksum is calculated as:
```
checksum = (magic + type + seq + len_lo + len_hi) & 0xFF
```

The v1 checksum is calculated by setting the checksum byte to 0x01, set `checksum = 0` then for each byte, `checksum = (checksum - byte) & 0xFF`

## Protocol Versions

### Detecting Protocol Version

The protocol version is automatically detected by reading the device's hardware and software version from the BLE Device Information Service:

**Standard BLE Characteristics:**
- Hardware Revision: `00002a27-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- Software Revision: `00002a28-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

**Version Detection Logic:**
- **V0**: Software version < R0007V0012 (older firmware)
- **V1**: Hardware 1.0.00+ OR Software R0007V0012 and newer
- **Default**: V1 (if version info unavailable)

**Example Version Strings:**
- Hardware: `1.0.00`
- Software: `R0007V0012` (Release 7, Version 12)

### Command Headers

All commands use a 4-byte header:
```
[version] [command_id] [direction] [padding]
```

- **V0 commands**: Start with `0x00` (e.g., `00F0A300`, `00F2A300`, `00F4A300`)
- **V1 commands**: Start with `0x01` (e.g., `01F0A300`, `01F1A300`, `0181D100`)

## Packet Types

### Status Packets (FROM Kettle)

#### 1. Compact Status (`0x22`)

**Total Length:** 18 bytes (6 header + 12 payload)

**Format:**
```
A5 22 [seq] [len_lo] [len_hi] [checksum] [payload: 12 bytes]
```

**Payload Structure:**

| Offset | Field | Description | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Header1 | Always `0x01` | - |
| 1 | Header2 | Always `0x41` | - |
| 2 | Reserved | Unknown | `0x40` |
| 3 | Reserved | Unknown | `0x00` |
| 4 | Stage | Heating stage | `0x01`=heating, `0x00`=not heating |
| 5 | Mode | Operating mode | `0x00`=normal, `0x04`=keep warm |
| 6 | Setpoint | Target temperature (°F) | 104-212 |
| 7 | Temperature | Current water temperature (°F) | 40-230 |
| 8 | Status | Heating status | `0x00`=idle, non-zero=heating |
| 9-11 | Unknown | Additional data | - |

**Note:** Compact status packets do NOT contain on-base detection information.

**Example:**
```
a5:22:5e:04:00:2f:01:41:40:00:00:00:d4:64:8c:00:00:00
```

#### 2. Status ACK (`0x12`)

**Important:** This is an ACK frame (type 0x12) with status payload. It's sent in response to status requests.

**Total Length:** 35 bytes (6 header + 29 payload) - FIXED LENGTH

**Format:**
```
A5 12 [seq] [len_lo] [len_hi] [checksum] [payload: 29 bytes]
```

**Payload Structure (29 bytes fixed):**

| Offset | Field | Description | Values |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0-3 | Command | Always `01404000` | - |
| 4 | Stage | Heating stage | See HeatingStage enum |
| 5 | Mode | Operating mode | See OperatingMode enum |
| 6 | Setpoint | Target temperature (°F) | 104-212 |
| 7 | Temperature | Current water temperature (°F) | 40-230 |
| 8 | MyTemp | Custom temperature setting | 104-212 |
| 9-13 | Padding | Unknown/reserved | - |
| **14** | **On-Base** | **Kettle placement** | **`0x00`=on-base, `0x01`=off-base** |
| 15-16 | Hold Time | Remaining hold time (seconds, big-endian) | 0-65535 |
| 17-27 | Padding | Unknown/reserved | - |
| 28 | Baby Mode | Baby formula mode | `0x01`=enabled, `0x00`=disabled |

**Important:** The on-base detection byte is at **offset 14** of the payload.

**Example (on-base, not heating):**
```
a5:12:19:1d:00:10:01:40:40:00:00:00:d4:5c:8c:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:3c:69:00:00:00:00:01:10:0e:00:00:01
                                                           ^^
                                                      byte 20 = 0x00 (on-base)
```

**Example (off-base):**
```
a5:12:1c:1d:00:0c:01:40:40:00:00:00:d4:5c:8c:00:00:00:00:00:01:00:00:3c:69:00:00:00:00:01:10:0e:00:00:01
                                                           ^^
                                                      byte 20 = 0x01 (off-base)
```

### Command Packets (TO Kettle)

#### 1. Status Request (`0x22`)

Request a status update from the kettle. Device responds with Status ACK (frame type 0x12).

**Format:**
```
A5 22 [seq] 04 00 [checksum] 01 40 40 00
```

**Example:**
```
A5 22 41 04 00 72 01 40 40 00
```

This is typically sent periodically (every 1-2 seconds) to request status updates from the kettle.

#### 2. Start Heating (`0x20`)

Start heating to the specified target temperature.

**Format:**
```
A5 20 [seq] 0C 00 [checksum] 01 41 40 00 [stage] [mode] [temp] 00 00 00 00 00
```

**Parameters:**
- `stage`: Set to `0x01` to start heating
- `mode`: `0x00` for normal heating, `0x04` for keep-warm mode
- `temp`: Target temperature in °F (104-212)

**Example (heat to 212°F):**
```
a5:20:5f:0c:00:2e:01:41:40:00:01:00:d4:00:00:00:00:00
                                    ^^    ^^
                               stage=0x01  temp=212(0xD4)
```

#### 3. Stop Heating (`0x20`)

Stop the current heating operation.

**Format:**
```
A5 20 [seq] 0C 00 [checksum] 01 41 40 00 00 00 [temp] 00 00 00 00 00
```

**Parameters:**
- `stage`: Set to `0x00` to stop heating
- `mode`: Set to `0x00`
- `temp`: Current setpoint (doesn't change anything)

**Example:**
```
a5:20:60:0c:00:2f:01:41:40:00:00:00:d4:00:00:00:00:00
                                    ^^
                               stage=0x00 (stop)
```

## State Detection

### On-Base Detection

The kettle reports whether it is physically placed on the charging base.

**Location:** Extended status packet, byte 20 (payload[14])

**Values:**
- `0x00`: Kettle is on the charging base
- `0x01`: Kettle has been removed from the base

**Behavior:**
- When the kettle is removed from the base while heating, it immediately stops heating
- The on-base status updates in real-time via extended status packets
- Compact status packets do NOT contain on-base information

**Important:** Initial implementations incorrectly used payload[4] (heating stage) which only worked "by accident" when removing the kettle during heating. The correct byte is payload[14].

### Heating Detection

**Location:** Both packet types, payload[4] (stage) and payload[8] (status)

**Values:**
- `payload[4]`: `0x01` when heating, `0x00` when idle
- `payload[8]`: `0x00` when idle, non-zero when heating

Both fields correlate with the heating state, but they serve different purposes. For reliable heating detection, check `payload[4] != 0`.

### Temperature Monitoring

**Location:** Both packet types, payload[6] (setpoint) and payload[7] (current)

**Temperature Ranges:**
- **Setpoint (commanded):** 104-212°F (40-100°C)
  - This is the range you can set as a target temperature
  - Device specification: 40°C to 100°C
- **Current (sensor validation):** 40-230°F
  - Readings outside this range indicate sensor errors or corrupted packets
- **Current (typical operation):** ~50-212°F
  - Cold tap water is typically 50-70°F
  - Maximum is boiling point at 212°F

**Units:** All temperature values are in Fahrenheit (°F).

**Validation:** If the current temperature reading is below 40°F or above 230°F, the packet should be discarded as invalid. In normal operation, you'll see temperatures from cold tap water (~50-70°F) up to boiling (212°F).

## Communication Flow

### Typical Session

1. **Connect** to BLE device
2. **Discover** service `0xFFF0` and characteristics `0xFFF1`, `0xFFF2`
3. **Read device information** (optional but recommended):
   - Hardware revision from `0x2A27`
   - Software revision from `0x2A28`
   - Model number from `0x2A24`
   - Manufacturer from `0x2A29`
4. **Detect protocol version** based on HW/SW versions
5. **Subscribe** to notifications on RX characteristic (`0xFFF1`)
6. **Send hello** command using detected protocol version
7. **Send poll** command to request initial status
8. **Receive** extended status packet with current state
9. **Monitor** notifications for status updates
10. **Send commands** via TX characteristic (`0xFFF2`) as needed

### Polling Strategy

The kettle does not automatically send status updates without prompting. Implement a polling loop:

```
Every 1-2 seconds:
  1. Send poll command (0x22)
  2. Wait for response
  3. Parse status packet
  4. Update internal state
```

If no response is received after 3-5 poll attempts, consider the kettle offline/disconnected.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Start Heating to 212°F

**Send:**
```
TX: a5:20:5f:0c:00:2e:01:41:40:00:01:00:d4:00:00:00:00:00
```

**Receive (heating):**
```
RX: a5:12:21:1d:00:c7:01:40:40:00:01:04:d4:5c:8c:01:10:0e:10:0e:00:00:00:3c:69:00:00:00:00:01:10:0e:00:00:01
    Status: Heating, temp=92°F (0x5C), setpoint=212°F (0xD4), on-base
```

**Receive (target reached):**
```
RX: a5:12:25:1d:00:03:01:40:40:00:00:00:d4:d4:8c:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:3c:69:00:00:00:00:01:10:0e:00:00:01
    Status: Idle, temp=212°F (0xD4), setpoint=212°F (0xD4), on-base
```

### Scenario 2: Remove Kettle While Heating

**Before removal (heating):**
```
RX: a5:12:23:1d:00:c4:01:40:40:00:01:04:d4:5c:8c:01:10:0e:10:0e:00:00:00:3c:69:00:00:00:00:01:10:0e:00:00:01
                                                           ^^
                                                      byte 20 = 0x00 (on-base)
```

**After removal:**
```
RX: a5:12:25:1d:00:03:01:40:40:00:00:00:d4:5c:8c:00:00:00:00:00:01:00:00:3c:69:00:00:00:00:01:10:0e:00:00:01
                                      ^^                   ^^
                               stage=0x00 (stopped)   byte 20 = 0x01 (off-base)
```

The kettle immediately stops heating when removed from the base.

### Scenario 3: Stop Heating

**Send:**
```
TX: a5:20:60:0c:00:2f:01:41:40:00:00:00:d4:00:00:00:00:00
                                      ^^
                                 stage=0x00 (stop)
```

**Receive:**
```
RX: a5:12:26:1d:00:02:01:40:40:00:00:00:d4:5c:8c:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:3c:69:00:00:00:00:01:10:0e:00:00:01
    Status: Idle, temp=92°F, setpoint=212°F, on-base
```

## Implementation Notes

### Sequence Numbers

- Maintain separate sequence counters for TX and RX
- Increment after each packet sent/received
- Sequence numbers wrap from 0xFF to 0x00
- Can be used to detect missed packets or verify packet order

### Error Handling

**Invalid Temperature:** If `payload[7]` is outside 40-230°F, ignore the packet or retain previous temperature.

**Missing Packets:** If no status received after multiple polls, mark device as offline.

**Checksum Mismatch:** Discard packets with invalid checksums.

### Packet Timing

- Poll interval: 1-2 seconds is sufficient
- Response latency: Expect response within 200-500ms
- Notification rate: Kettle may send unsolicited notifications during heating (temperature changes)

### Connection Management

- BLE connection may drop if kettle is off-base for extended periods
- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Maximum connection range: ~10 meters (typical BLE range)

## Discoveries and Corrections

During development, several incorrect assumptions were made and corrected:

### Incorrect: Using Compact Packet for On-Base Detection

**Initial Attempt:** Used `payload[4]` (stage byte) from compact packets for on-base detection.

**Problem:** This byte tracks **heating state**, not on-base state. It appeared to work when removing the kettle during heating (because removal stops heating), but failed when the kettle was idle.

**Correct:** On-base detection must use extended packet `payload[14]` (byte 20).

### Incorrect: Byte Position for On-Base Status

**Initial Attempt:** Used `payload[18]` based on incorrect packet analysis.

**Problem:** Wrong byte offset.

**Correct:** The on-base indicator is at byte 20 of the full packet, which is `payload[14]` after stripping the 6-byte header.

### Temperature Conversion Issues

**Initial Attempt:** Treated temperature values as Celsius and converted to Fahrenheit.

**Problem:** Values are already in Fahrenheit. Converting them resulted in readings like 414°F.

**Correct:** Temperature values in packets are already in Fahrenheit (°F). No conversion needed.

## Protocol Reverse Engineering

This protocol was reverse-engineered through:
1. BLE packet capture using smartphone app communication
2. Systematic testing of on-base/off-base scenarios
3. Heating and cooling cycle monitoring
4. Trial-and-error with byte field analysis
5. Validation against multiple real-world test scenarios

Special thanks to the implementation efforts that identified the correct byte positions through careful packet analysis.

## V1 Protocol Commands

### Registration Commands

#### Register (Pairing)
**Command:** `0180D100` + 32-byte registration key

Device must be in pairing mode. To enter pairing mode, **press and hold the "MyBrew" button** on the kettle. Generate a 16-byte random key and encode as ASCII hex (32 bytes).

**Example:**
```
A5 22 00 24 00 [cs] 01 80 D1 00 [32 bytes of ASCII hex key]
```

**Response:** ACK with payload `00` on success.

#### Hello (Reconnect)
**Command:** `0181D100` + 32-byte registration key

Use previously registered key to reconnect.

### Heating Commands

#### Start Heating
**Command:** `01F0A300` + mode (2B BE) + hold_enable (1B) + hold_time (2B BE)

**Modes:**
- `0100`: Green Tea (180°F / 82°C)

**Command:** `01F1A300` + delay (2B BE) + mode (2B BE) + hold_enable (1B) + hold_time (2B BE)

**Delay range:** 0 minutes to 12 hours (0-43200 seconds, big-endian)

**Example:**
```
Delay 1 hour, boil, no hold: A5 22 xx 0B 00 [cs] 01 F1 A3 00 0E 10 04 00 00 00 00
```

#### Stop Heating
**Command:** `01F4A300`

```
A5 22 xx 04 00 [cs] 01 F4 A3 00
```

### Configuration Commands

#### Set MyBrew Temperature
**Command:** `01F3A300` + temperature (1B)

Set custom temperature for MyBrew mode (40-100°C / 104-212°F).

**Example:**
```
Set 179°F: A5 22 1C 05 00 [cs] 01 F3 A3 00 B3
```

#### Set Baby Formula Mode
**Command:** `01F5A300` + enabled (1B)

Enable special baby formula temperature mode.

**Example:**
```
Enable:  A5 22 25 05 00 [cs] 01 F5 A3 00 01
Disable: A5 22 1D 05 00 [cs] 01 F5 A3 00 00
```

### Completion Notifications

**Command:** `01F7A300` + status (1B)

Sent by device when heating completes.

**Status values:**
- `0x20`: Heating complete (may enter hold mode)
- `0x21`: Hold timer complete

**Examples:**
```
Done:          A5 22 98 05 00 [cs] 01 F7 A3 00 20
Hold complete: A5 22 E1 05 00 [cs] 01 F7 A3 00 21
```

## Extended Status Fields

Extended status packets (frame type `0x12`) contain additional fields:

| Offset | Field | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | mytemp_f | Custom temperature setting |
| 10-11 | hold_time_remaining | Seconds remaining in hold (big-endian) |
| 14 | on_base | `0x00`=on-base, `0x01`=off-base |
| 20 | error_code | Error indicator (0=no error) |
| 22 | baby_mode | `0x01`=enabled, `0x00`=disabled |

## Error States

Error states are indicated by:
- Suspicious temperature values (e.g., `0xB004` = 45060°F)
- Non-zero error_code in extended status
- Duplicate error values in multiple temperature fields

## Future Research

Areas not yet fully understood:

- **Error code meanings:** Specific error codes not yet documented
- **Firmware updates:** OTA update mechanism (if any) not documented

## References

- **Implementation:** Home Assistant custom component in `custom_components/cosori_kettle_ble/`
- **Test captures:** `offbase.json` and various log files
- **Discussion:** Protocol analysis throughout development conversation

## ACK-Based Communication

V1 protocol supports ACK (acknowledgment) packets:

**Frame Type:** `0x12` (same as extended status)

**ACK Packet Structure:**
```
A5 12 [seq] [len_lo] [len_hi] [checksum] [command_header] [payload]
```

The ACK mirrors the sequence number and command header from the original message. For registration/hello commands, the payload indicates success:
- `0x00`: Success
- Other values: Failure

**Recommended Flow:**
1. Send command with sequence number
2. Wait for ACK with matching sequence number (timeout: 1-2 seconds)
3. Check ACK payload for success indicator
4. Retry or handle failure as needed

This replaces timing-based delays with proper protocol acknowledgments.
