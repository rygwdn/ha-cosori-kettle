# Home Assistant Integration

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots menu in the top right
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/rygwdn/CosoriKettleBLE`
6. Select category "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "Cosori Kettle BLE" in HACS and click "Download"
9. Restart Home Assistant
10. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration
11. Search for "Cosori Kettle BLE"

### Manual Installation

1. Copy `custom_components/cosori_kettle_ble` to your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration
4. Search for "Cosori Kettle BLE"

## Configuration

The integration supports automatic Bluetooth discovery. Your kettle must be:
- Powered on and on its base
- Within Bluetooth range
- **NOT connected to another device** (disconnect from official app first)

### First-Time Pairing

To pair your kettle for the first time:
1. **Press and hold the "MyBrew" button** on the kettle until it enters pairing mode
2. The kettle will be discoverable via Bluetooth
3. Follow the Home Assistant configuration flow to complete pairing

### Capturing Registration Key from Mobile App

If you've already paired your kettle with the official Cosori mobile app, you can extract the registration key by capturing Bluetooth traffic:

#### iOS/macOS
Use PacketLogger via Apple's Bluetooth debugging profile:
- Follow the guide at: https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/a-new-way-to-debug-iosbluetooth-applications/
- Open the Cosori app and connect to your kettle
- Look for three consecutive packets sent to the kettle

#### Android
Use Android's built-in Bluetooth HCI snoop log:
- Guide: https://sps-support.honeywell.com/s/article/How-to-capture-Bluetooth-traffic-from-and-to-an-Android-Device
- Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log in Developer Options
- Open the Cosori app and connect to your kettle
- Retrieve the btsnoop_hci.log file

#### Extracting the Registration Key

When you open the app, it sends three consecutive packets to the kettle. Look for:
1. **First packet** (exactly 20 bytes): `a5 XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 0181d100 YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY`
2. **Second packet** (exactly 20 bytes): Full payload is needed
3. **Third packet** (exactly 2 bytes): Final bytes needed

The registration key is formed by:
- Taking the last 10 bytes from the first packet (after the `0181d100` command bytes)
- Concatenating with all 20 bytes from the second packet
- Concatenating with all 2 bytes from the third packet
- These 32 bytes are ASCII-encoded hex characters representing the 16-byte registration key

The Home Assistant config flow includes a helper to parse these packets automatically. Simply paste the three raw packets into the config UI.

# Climate Entity & Thermostat Card

The integration automatically creates a climate entity in Home Assistant, allowing you to use the native thermostat card with its semi-circle temperature slider.

### Provided Entities

- **Climate entity** - Off/Heat mode with temperature control and preset modes
- **Sensors** - Temperature, Setpoint, On Base status, Heating status
- **Switches** - Heating control
- **Number slider** - Target temperature adjustment (104-212°F)

### Using the Thermostat Card

Add to your Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
type: thermostat
entity: climate.cosori_kettle
```

The thermostat card provides:
- **Semi-circle temperature slider** (40-100°C / 104-212°F)
- **Current temperature** display
- **Mode control** (OFF / HEAT)
- **Preset modes** (Boil, Green Tea, Oolong, Coffee)
- **Action indicator** (IDLE / HEATING)

### How It Works

- **OFF mode**: Kettle is idle, not heating
- **HEAT mode**: Kettle will heat to target temperature
- **Preset modes**:
  - Boil: 212°F (100°C)
  - Green Tea: 180°F (82°C)
  - Oolong: 195°F (91°C)
  - Coffee: 205°F (96°C)
  - MyBrew: Custom temperature (configurable)
- **Temperature slider**: Adjust custom temperature (40-100°C / 104-212°F)
- **Current temperature**: Shows actual water temperature
- **Action**: Shows HEATING when actively warming, IDLE otherwise

**Note:** Home Assistant displays temperatures in your preferred unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The kettle natively uses Fahrenheit, and all conversions are handled automatically.

# Usage Examples

## Starting the Kettle

**Using Climate Entity (Recommended):**
```yaml
service: climate.set_preset_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.kettle
data:
  preset_mode: boil  # or green_tea, oolong, coffee
```

**Using Individual Entities:**
1. Set target temperature:
   ```yaml
   service: number.set_value
   target:
     entity_id: number.kettle_target_temperature
   data:
     value: 180
   ```

2. Turn on heating:
   ```yaml
   service: switch.turn_on
   target:
     entity_id: switch.kettle_heating
   ```

## Stopping the Kettle

```yaml
service: climate.set_hvac_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.kettle
data:
  hvac_mode: "off"
```

## Home Assistant Automations

### Morning Kettle Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Morning Kettle"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.kettle_on_base
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: climate.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.kettle
        data:
          preset_mode: coffee
```

### Kettle Ready Notification

**Note:** The kettle holds temperature when it reaches setpoint, so heating doesn't turn off. Use temperature threshold instead:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Kettle Ready"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.kettle_temperature
        above: 205  # Trigger a few degrees before setpoint
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.kettle_heating
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Kettle Ready"
          message: "Your water is hot! ☕"
```

# Protocol Information

This component implements the Cosori kettle BLE protocol. The protocol version (V0/V1) is automatically detected from the kettle's firmware version.

See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for complete details.

# Troubleshooting

## Kettle Not Connecting / Not Found

1. **Check for active connections**: The kettle only supports ONE BLE connection at a time. Disconnect from the official app or any other integration first
2. **Check MAC address**: Ensure it matches your kettle
3. **Check distance**: Bluetooth adapter should be within ~10m of kettle
4. **Check kettle**: Ensure it's on the base and powered
5. **Check logs**: Enable debug logging
6. **Restart**: Power cycle the kettle and/or restart Home Assistant

## Kettle Shows "Unavailable"

- Check Bluetooth adapter status in Home Assistant
- Verify Bluetooth adapter is online
- Restart Home Assistant

## Commands Not Working

- Ensure kettle is on base (`binary_sensor.kettle_on_base` should be ON)
- Check connection status
- Enable debug logging to see protocol packets

## Temperature Doesn't Reach Exact Setpoint

The kettle may report temperatures 1-3°F below the setpoint when holding temperature. This is normal behavior:

- The kettle cycles heating to maintain temperature
- Temperature readings may fluctuate between 209-212°F when set to 212°F
- Use a threshold automation (e.g., `above: 205`) instead of exact temperature matching

**For accurate temperature monitoring**, use the dedicated `sensor.kettle_temperature` entity in your automations rather than the climate entity's current temperature.

## Using Official Mobile App

To use the official Cosori mobile app (which requires exclusive BLE access):

1. Remove the integration from Home Assistant (Settings > Devices & Services)
2. Use the official app
3. When done, disconnect from the app
4. Re-add the integration in Home Assistant

# Debug Logging

**Home Assistant:**
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.cosori_kettle_ble: debug
```

---

# Development

## Python Library

A standalone Python library is included at `custom_components/cosori_kettle_ble/cosori_kettle/` for controlling the kettle outside of Home Assistant.

See [custom_components/cosori_kettle_ble/cosori_kettle/README.md](custom_components/cosori_kettle_ble/cosori_kettle/README.md) for library documentation and API details.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run library tests only
uv run pytest tests/library/ -v

# Run HA component tests only
uv run pytest tests/ha_component/ -v
```
